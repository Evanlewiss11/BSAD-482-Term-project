Data Wrangling Summary – Global Sea Level Rise Dataset

Removed Unnecessary Columns


Deleted extra columns that were not relevant to the analysis, such as metadata or redundant values.
Kept only the necessary columns: Year and Sea Level Change (mm from 1993–2008 average).
Renamed Columns for Clarity


Changed "mm from 1993-2008 average" to "Sea Level Change (mm)" to make it easier to understand.
Ensured column names were simple and intuitive for visualization.
Removed Missing and Duplicate Data


Checked for and removed rows where sea level data was missing.
Removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
Standardized Data Types


Converted "Year" to an integer format.
Ensured "Sea Level Change (mm)" was stored as a numeric value to avoid formatting issues.
2. Data Wrangling Summary –  Severe Weather
Removed Unnecessary Columns


Deleted extra columns that were not relevant to the analysis, such as metadata or redundant values.
Kept only the necessary columns: Year, Tornadoes and Fatalities.

Removed Missing and Duplicate Data


Checked for and removed rows where severe weather data was missing.
Removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.

Data Wrangling Summary – Yearly C02 Admissions 
Removed Unnecessary Columns


Deleted extra columns that were not relevant to the analysis, such as metadata or redundant values.
Kept only the necessary columns: Year and Entity and annual co2 emissions

Removed Missing and Duplicate Data


Checked for and removed rows where c02 emission data was missing.
Removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.

	4. Data Wrangling Summary – Renewable Energy					
Removed Unnecessary Columns
Deleted extra columns that were not relevant to the analysis, such as metadata or redundant values.
Kept only the necessary columns: Year and Entity and Energy renewables

Removed Missing and Duplicate Data


Checked for and removed rows where energy renewable data was missing.
Removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
5. Data Wrangling Summary – Global Temperature Anomalies vs. CO₂ Emissions Dataset
Removed Unnecessary Columns


In the CO₂ dataset, removed columns unrelated to total emissions, such as:
Country-specific CO₂ values
Other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, etc.)
Energy consumption details not relevant to CO₂
In the Temperature Anomalies dataset, kept only Year and Global Temperature Anomaly (°C).
Renamed Columns for Clarity


"J-D" (January–December temperature anomaly) → "Global Temperature Anomaly (°C)"
"year" → "Year" to match formats between both datasets.
"co2" → "CO₂ Emissions (Million Metric Tons)" to clarify the unit of measurement.
Filtered Data to Match Year Ranges


Kept only matching years in both datasets.
Removed any years in the CO₂ dataset that didn’t have a corresponding temperature anomaly.
Checked for Missing or Duplicate Values


Dropped any missing values in either dataset to prevent errors in Tableau.
Removed duplicate records that might have been included in either dataset.
Merged the Two Datasets


Joined the CO₂ and Temperature Anomalies datasets on Year to create a combined dataset.
Ensured that every row contained a matching CO₂ value and temperature anomaly for each year.
