## **Climate Change Impact Analysis Project**

A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Global Climate Change Trends 

*By: Evan Lewis*

## **Executive Summary**

This project investigates the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global weather patterns, focusing on temperature fluctuations, sea level rise, and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, affecting ecosystems, human health, economic stability, and global security. The urgency to address climate change stems from its widespread consequences, including rising global temperatures, shrinking ice sheets, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss. These changes not only threaten natural habitats but also have significant implications for agriculture, water resources, and human settlements.

Through comprehensive data analysis, we aim to identify key trends, predict future climate scenarios, and recommend mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project leverages datasets from reputable climate organizations, such as NASA, NOAA, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to provide evidence-based insights into the current state of the climate. Our approach integrates statistical analysis with data visualization techniques to uncover critical insights into climate change and its far-reaching effects.

By examining historical climate data and projecting future trends, we seek to understand the drivers of climate change and their impacts on different regions of the world. This analysis will help policymakers, researchers, and the public make informed decisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and promote sustainable development.

Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to global efforts to combat climate change by providing actionable insights and fostering greater awareness of the urgent need for climate action. This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in addressing one of humanity’s most critical challenges.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Global Temperature Anomaly Index (GTAI)
- *Understanding temperature deviations allows for better climate policy decisions, helping to shape mitigation efforts and track global warming trends.*
- **Measures:** Percentage change in average global temperature deviations from historical baselines.
- **Target:** Limit temperature rise to below **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels.
- **Baseline:** Current increase of approximately **1.1°C**.
- **Frequency:** Monthly updates based on global climate models.

### 2. Sea Level Rise Rate (SLRR)
- **Measures:** The rate of global sea level rise annually.
- **Target:** Stabilize sea level rise through emission reductions.
- **Monitoring:** Annual satellite-based measurements from NOAA and NASA.

### 3. Frequency of Extreme Weather Events (FEWE)
- **Tracks:** The number of extreme weather events (hurricanes, wildfires, floods) per year.
- **Target:** Reduce occurrence through climate resilience measures.
- **Review:** Annual analysis of global event data.

### 4. Carbon Emissions Reduction Rate (CERR)
- **Evaluates:** The annual reduction rate of global CO₂ emissions.
- **Target:** Achieve **net-zero emissions by 2050**.
- **Assessment:** Based on national and international emission reports.

### 5. Renewable Energy Adoption Index (REAI)
- **Measures:** The percentage of global energy consumption from renewable sources.
- **Target:** Reach **50% renewable energy usage globally by 2030**.
- **Tracking:** Annual energy reports from international organizations.

### 6. Additional Indicators for Better Context and Causality
- **Global CO₂ Emissions:** Tracks total global emissions as a primary driver of climate change.
- **GDP and Energy Consumption Correlation:** Examines how economic growth impacts emissions and sustainability efforts.
- **Deforestation Rate:** Measures the annual rate of forest loss, a major factor in carbon sequestration.

These additional indicators provide a more **comprehensive understanding of climate change drivers and their interdependencies**, strengthening our ability to establish causality in climate trends.
