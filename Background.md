# **Understanding Climate Change: Impact, Trends, and Mitigation Strategies**

*By:Evan Lewis*

A Data-Driven Approach to Global Climate Change

## **Problem Context**

Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity today, influencing ecosystems, human health, and economic stability worldwide. The continuous rise in global temperatures, increasing sea levels, and the growing frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods highlight the urgent need for data-driven strategies to mitigate its impact. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial activities, are the primary drivers of these changes. Their accumulation in the atmosphere traps heat, leading to global warming and a cascade of environmental disruptions. As climate change accelerates, its impacts are becoming more pronounced, particularly in vulnerable regions with limited resources to adapt. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, while prolonged droughts and intense storms jeopardize food security and freshwater availability. The economic costs of climate-related disasters are escalating, affecting global supply chains and exacerbating social inequalities. This project seeks to analyze climate data to better understand these trends and propose actionable solutions to mitigate their effects.

## **Significance of the Study**

The study of climate change is critical for several reasons. Climate change affects every region of the world, with some areas experiencing more severe consequences than others, such as small island nations facing existential threats from rising sea levels. Understanding the patterns and drivers of climate change helps policymakers develop targeted strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability. The economic impacts of climate-related disasters, including infrastructure damage and agricultural losses, necessitate proactive measures to minimize costs and protect livelihoods. Additionally, addressing climate change is essential for achieving global development goals, including poverty reduction, health improvements, and environmental sustainability. Without immediate and sustained action, the long-term consequences could be catastrophic for both the environment and human society.

## **Research Objectives**

This project aims to:

1. Analyze historical and current climate data to identify trends and patterns in global temperature changes, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.  
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of existing climate mitigation strategies and identify areas for improvement.  
3. Assess the socio-economic impacts of climate change on different regions and populations.  
4. Propose data-driven recommendations for policymakers, businesses, and communities to enhance climate resilience and reduce the risks associated with a warming planet.
